Here is my written report for the Module 4 Challenge.

The code that I wrote takes the data from the two spread sheets, and combines them into multiple data frame that show how the different categories of data are related to each other.

One strange conclusion that can be drawn from my anaylsis is that more school spending seemed to correlate to a higher percentage of students passing math and reading.
Another conclusion I reached is that the scores of students from greades 9 to 12 will generally remain the same for any school. That is to say, the students do not improve or regress throughout the grades.
